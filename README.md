converts folders of songs to m3u file for ps3, psp, psvita

# how does it work
oh it works by taking your folders of music and converts them into a m3u for youre ps3, psp, psvita 

# how to use 
do you have a folder full of 7,142 audio files from 2008 to 2023 and no clue what’s even in there anymore?  
do you desperately want to feel productive without actually doing anything?

introducing **m3ugenplay**:  
a small, cursed `.m3u` playlist generator made with more sarcasm than actual code.

## 🖼️ visual tutorial because reading is hard

### step 1: open the app (aka press things randomly)
![screenshot1](screenshots/open.png)

you're greeted by what looks like a windows 98 prank app. that’s the gui. it’s not gonna get better.

---

### step 2: choose the musical folder™  
click the button that says something like “or find it vro”. it’s not lying.  
pick a folder full of `.mp3`, `.wav`, or whatever other audio chaos you downloaded from thepiratebay in 2009.

---

### step 3: name your playlist like it’s 2012  
type anything. “sadboiszn.m3u”. “bussin_beats”. “projectxbutworse”.  
you do you.

### step 4: click the green button and pray  
you know the one — it says "create your dummy playlist".  
click it. then don’t touch anything. it might be doing something. or not.

---

### step 5: celebrate. or don’t.  
congrats. your playlist is now in that same folder.  
no fanfare. no confetti. just a `.m3u` file that probably works.

## 💡 features (if you can call them that)
- accepts `.mp3`, `.wav`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, `.m4a` because variety is pain.
- saves playlists in the same place your music lives — no fancy directories here.
- includes passive-aggressive error messages for motivation.
- has a help button that just insults you more.

## ⚙️ how to run it (the not-funny part)

### if you hate python:
just download the `.exe` from [releases](https://github.com/kextan/m3ugenplay/releases/latest) and double-click it poopy

### if you're a nerd™:
go to the folder you put the code in
pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --noconsole --onefile --icon=icon.ico m3ugenplay.py

## 🎮 how to force your playlist onto ancient consoles:

### 🕹 psp (aka mp3 walkman with buttons)

1. plug in your fossil (aka the psp) via usb or shove the memory stick into a reader like it's 2005  
2. navigate to:  

/MUSIC

3. slap that `.m3u` file right there with the rest of your *songs*  
4. unplug with confidence. go to *music* on the XMB. if it shows up, congrats. if not, cry.

> ✨ tip: the psp likes `.m3u`, but it’s picky. keep paths simple. if your song has a name like `Linkin Park - In The End.mp3`, just rename it to `a.mp3` or something. you’re welcome.

### 🧊 ps3 (aka the warmest console ever built)

1. put the `.m3u` and your music files on a flash drive (formatted FAT32 because sony is allergic to progress)  
2. structure should look like:

/PS3/MUSIC/your files here

3. plug the usb into ps3  
4. open the music section → triangle button → *Display All*  
5. now scroll past 900 options till you find your playlist  
6. enjoy while your ps3 fan screams like it’s launching a space shuttle

---

### 🔮 psvita (aka the handheld that deserved better)

1. install content manager on your poopy pc
2. plug in dat vita and go to the music app
3. go to your computer and find the m3u file you have
4. put it in your music folder on your user dir
5. on vita, music app opened right? go to the first button with your computer name
6. click it and go to playlists
7. click the 3 dots and click copy
8. start it idk what u want me to do

(its the end of the read me)
